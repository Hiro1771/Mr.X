            <h1>How Old Is Bart?</h1>
            <p id="textP">How old really is Bart Simpson? Well in season 1 Episode 1 he was 10 years old. And that episode aired in December of 1989, so 10 ago from 1989 would be 1979. Now we have a year he was born we just need to find the date. On the Episode Simpsorama (S26 E6) Homer tells Bart to prove it is really him, and Bart says “My birthday is February 23rd.” So that would mean Bart was born February 23rd 1979, so that would make Him 45 years old. To me more exact, he is 45 year 10 months and 9 days old to the day this article was written.
